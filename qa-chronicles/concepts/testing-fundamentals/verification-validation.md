# Verification vs Validation

## Definitions
**Verification:** "Are we building the product right?"
- Ensures that the product is being built according to requirements, standards, and design documents.
- Checking documents, design, code
- Static testing methods
- Example: Reviews, walkthroughs, inspections

**Validation:** "Are we building the right product?"
- Ensures that the final product meets the requirements, standards, and design documents.
- Evaluating final product
- Dynamic testing methods
- Example: Functional testing, user acceptance testing

## Key Differences
| Aspect | Verification | Validation |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Timing | During development | After development |
| Focus | Process | Product |
| Question | Are we building it right? | Are we building the right thing? |
| Methods | Reviews, inspections | Testing, user feedback |
