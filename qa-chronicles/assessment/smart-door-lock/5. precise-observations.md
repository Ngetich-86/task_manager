# Precise Observation Examples

## 🎯 Objective
Document system behavior with specific, measurable details that enable accurate reproduction and understanding.

## 📋 Observation Framework

### Essential Elements of Precise Observation:
1. **Specific Context** - Exact conditions and environment
2. **Measurable Data** - Numbers, times, counts
3. **Reproducible Steps** - Clear sequence of actions
4. **Expected vs Actual** - What should happen vs what did happen
5. **No Assumptions** - Only observable facts

## 🔍 Observation Templates

### Template 1: Basic Bug Observation
```markdown
**Observation ID:** DL-001
**Date/Time:** 2024-01-15 14:32:15
**Tester:** [Your Name]
**Environment:** iPhone 14, iOS 17.2, Lock Firmware v2.1.3

**Test Scenario:** Unlock with low phone battery and weak signal

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Set phone battery to 8%
2. Move to location with Wi-Fi signal strength -82 dBm
3. Stand 3 meters from door with one interior wall between
4. Open SmartLock app at 14:32:00
5. Tap "Unlock" button at 14:32:15

**Expected Behavior:**
- Door unlocks within 3-5 seconds
- App shows "Unlocked successfully"
- Green LED flashes on lock

**Actual Behavior:**
- App showed "Connecting..." for 8 seconds (14:32:15-14:32:23)
- Changed to "Sending command..." for 5 seconds (14:32:23-14:32:28)
- Door audibly unlocked at 14:32:30 (15 seconds total)
- App showed "Unlocked successfully" at 14:32:32
- Green LED flashed at 14:32:33

**Additional Observations:**
- Phone battery dropped from 8% to 6% during process
- Wi-Fi disconnected and reconnected twice during attempt
- App remained responsive throughout
- No error messages displayed

**Impact Assessment:**
- High - User may think lock failed and try multiple times
- Medium - Delayed access in urgent situations
- Low - Eventually successful

**Reproducibility:** 7/10 attempts with same conditions
**Priority:** P1 - Performance degradation under common conditions


## Template 2 
**Observation ID:** DL-002
**Date/Time:** 2024-01-15 15:45:30
**Tester:** [Your Name]
**Environment:** Samsung Galaxy S23, Android 14, Lock Firmware v2.1.3

**Test Scenario:** Manual override followed by app status check

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Use physical key to unlock door at 15:45:00
2. Close door (remains unlocked)
3. Open SmartLock app at 15:45:30
4. Navigate to lock status screen

**Expected Behavior:**
- App shows "Unlocked" status
- Last activity shows "Manually unlocked at 15:45"

**Actual Behavior:**
- App shows "Locked" status (incorrect)
- Last activity shows "Unlocked by [User] at 15:42" (stale data)
- Refresh button does not update status
- Force-closing and reopening app shows same incorrect status

**Additional Observations:**
- Physical lock shows green unlocked indicator
- Door can be opened without resistance
- App continues to show incorrect status for 2+ minutes
- Status eventually corrects after app background/foreground cycle

**Data Captured:**
- Screenshot: app_status_incorrect.png
- Video: manual_override_discrepancy.mp4
- Logs: network_traffic_capture.pcap

**Impact Assessment:**
- Critical - Security risk (shows locked when actually unlocked)
- High - User confusion and potential security breach
- Medium - Requires app restart to correct

**Reproducibility:** 10/10 attempts
**Priority:** P0 - Safety and security risk

## Template 3
**Observation ID:** DL-003
**Date/Time:** 2024-01-15 16:20:45
**Tester:** [Your Name]
**Environment:** iPhone 14 Pro, iOS 17.2, Wi-Fi disabled

**Test Scenario:** Bluetooth disconnection during unlock

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Disable phone Wi-Fi and cellular data
2. Enable Bluetooth only
3. Pair with lock (distance: 1 meter)
4. Initiate unlock command
5. Immediately walk away (increase distance to 15+ meters)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Connection timeout after 10 seconds
- Clear error message: "Connection lost"
- Option to retry or use alternative method

**Actual Behavior:**
- App shows "Unlocking..." indefinitely (5+ minutes observed)
- No timeout occurs
- No error message displayed
- App becomes unresponsive to other commands
- Force quit required to regain functionality

**Additional Observations:**
- Bluetooth connection lost at ~12 meters distance
- Phone shows Bluetooth disconnected in settings
- Lock shows blinking blue LED (attempting connection)
- No audible feedback from lock
- Battery drain: 3% during 5-minute hang

**Data Measurements:**
- Signal loss distance: 12.3 meters
- Time to disconnect: 4.2 seconds after walkaway
- App hang duration: 5+ minutes (test stopped)
- Battery impact: 8mA constant drain during hang

**Impact Assessment:**
- High - App becomes unusable
- Medium - User confusion and frustration
- Low - Eventually recovers after force quit

**Reproducibility:** 8/10 attempts
**Priority:** P1 - Poor error handling
