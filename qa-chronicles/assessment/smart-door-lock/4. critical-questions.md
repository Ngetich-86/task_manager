# Critical Questions: Smart Door Lock

## 🎯 Objective
Uncover hidden risks, challenge assumptions, and identify edge cases through strategic questioning.

## 📋 Question Categories

### 1. Safety & Emergency Scenarios
**"What if..." Questions:**
- What if there's a fire and the lock fails to unlock?
- What if someone is having a medical emergency inside and needs paramedic access?
- What if the lock malfunctions and traps someone inside/outside during extreme weather?
- What if the manual override key is lost or broken?

**"Why..." Questions:**
- Why does the system handle power failures this specific way?
- Why aren't there redundant unlocking methods for emergencies?
- Why is the battery warning threshold set at 10% instead of 20%?

### 2. Connectivity & Network Issues
**"What if..." Questions:**
- What if the user loses internet connectivity while trying to unlock from a remote location?
- What if Bluetooth disconnects mid-unlock command?
- What if both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth fail simultaneously?
- What if the phone's battery dies during the unlocking process?
- What if the user is in an area with severe electromagnetic interference?

**"Why..." Questions:**
- Why does the lock prioritize Bluetooth over Wi-Fi for local access?
- Why is there a 30-second timeout for connection attempts?
- Why doesn't the app cache credentials for offline access?

### 3. Security & Access Control
**"What if..." Questions:**
- What if someone tries to brute-force the PIN code?
- What if a guest's access isn't automatically revoked after their scheduled time?
- What if two authorized users try to unlock simultaneously from different locations?
- What if someone clones the Bluetooth signal to spoof the lock?
- What if the cloud database is compromised?

**"Why..." Questions:**
- Why are PIN codes limited to 4-6 digits instead of supporting longer passwords?
- Why doesn't the system alert the owner after multiple failed access attempts?
- Why are encryption keys stored the way they are?

### 4. Power & Battery Management
**"What if..." Questions:**
- What if the lock battery dies completely while the door is locked?
- What if the battery is removed and reinserted during operation?
- What if someone tries to charge the lock while it's actively being used?
- What if extreme temperatures affect battery performance?

**"Why..." Questions:**
- Why does the low battery warning appear at 15% instead of providing earlier warnings?
- Why isn't there a physical indicator of battery status on the lock itself?
- Why doesn't the system provide estimated time remaining at current usage levels?

### 5. User Experience & Accessibility
**"What if..." Questions:**
- What if a visually impaired user needs to operate the lock?
- What if an elderly user with shaky hands tries to use the mobile app?
- What if a child needs to be able to unlock the door?
- What if the user's primary language isn't supported in the app?

**"Why..." Questions:**
- Why is the unlock button positioned where it is in the UI?
- Why does the success feedback use this specific sound/visual?
- Why isn't there voice control integration?

### 6. Multi-User & Family Scenarios
**"What if..." Questions:**
- What if parents want to give temporary access to a babysitter?
- What if roommates need different access levels?
- What if access needs to be granted to emergency services?
- What if users need to transfer ownership of the lock?

**"Why..." Questions:**
- Why are permission levels structured this specific way?
- Why can't users create custom access schedules?
- Why isn't there an "emergency override" for trusted contacts?

### 7. Physical & Environmental Factors
**"What if..." Questions:**
- What if the door frame shifts and affects the lock mechanism?
- What if moisture gets into the electronic components?
- What if the lock is installed on a metal door that interferes with signals?
- What if someone tries to physically tamper with the lock?

**"Why..." Questions:**
- Why is the lock rated for specific temperature ranges?
- Why does the installation process require specific clearances?
- Why isn't there tamper detection for physical attacks?

### 8. Integration & Ecosystem
**"What if..." Questions:**
- What if the user wants to integrate with their smart home system?
- What if there's a conflict with other Bluetooth devices in the area?
- What if the user switches phone platforms (iOS to Android)?
- What if the cloud service is discontinued?

**"Why..." Questions:**
- Why are certain smart home platforms supported but not others?
- Why does firmware updating work this specific way?
- Why is data backup optional rather than automatic?

## 📝 Question Analysis Framework

### For Each Question, Consider:
1. **Impact:** How serious would this failure be?
2. **Probability:** How likely is this scenario?
3. **Detection:** How easily would we notice this issue?
4. **Mitigation:** What could prevent or minimize impact?
