# Task Manager PolyStack Lab — My End-to-End Engineering Playground

Welcome to **Task Manager PolyStack Lab**, a multi-tech, multi-discipline learning ground where I explore everything from **Quality Assurance**, **Backend Engineering**, **Frontend Frameworks**, **APIs**, **CLIs**, and even **DevOps concepts**.

This repository started as a simple “Task Manager” project — but quickly evolved into a **full learning ecosystem** where I experiment with different languages, frameworks, architectures, and testing philosophies.  
It’s messy, honest, practical, and full of real experiments — exactly how learning should be.

## Purpose of This Repo

This repository exists as my:  

- **Hands-on sandbox** for learning new technologies  
- **Reference hub** where I revisit concepts  
- **Place to compare frameworks** (Angular vs Vue vs React, Spring vs Node vs NestJS, etc.)  
- **QA-to-Dev journey tracker** as I grow from testing into full engineering  
- **DevOps starter ground**, integrating scripts, automation, structure, and tooling  

It documents my **engineering evolution** over time.

## 🧩 What’s Inside (Tech Breakdown)

Each folder represents a different experiment around building a simple *Task Manager* application — but implemented using different technology stacks.

---

### 🔹 Frontend Experiments

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `angular-frontend` | Exploring Angular fundamentals, modules, services, routing & RxJS. |
| `vue-frontend` | Learning Vue’s reactivity system, components, and store management (Pinia/Vuex). |

---

### 🔹 Backend Experiments

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `node-backend-qa` | A Node.js backend built intentionally through a QA lens: risk analysis, test techniques, bug hunting. |
| `node-express-backend` | Classic Express REST API to understand routes, controllers, middleware, and validation. |
| `nest-marketplace-api` | A NestJS experiment for enterprise architecture, modules, providers, and structured APIs. |
| `spring-backend` | Java Spring Boot backend exploring controllers, services, JPA, REST patterns. |

---

### 🔹 Other Experiments

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `python-cli` | A Python CLI tool to practice scripting, automation, and terminal interaction. |
| `qa-chronicles` | My QA learning journal: test cases, SDLC concepts, exploratory/smoke/regression testing, etc. |

---

## 🌱 Why This Repo Exists

Because learning isn’t linear.  
Because real growth happens through **experimentation across multiple stacks**.  
Because great engineers understand multiple worlds and how they connect.

This repo documents my progression from:

**QA → Developer → Multi-stack Engineer → DevOps-aware Builder**

It’s not meant to be perfect — it’s meant to show **curiosity, progress, and exploration**.

---

## 🔮 What’s Next?

Planned improvements:

- Add Docker setups for each backend  
- Add automated tests for Spring & NestJS  
- Create standardized API docs across stacks  
- Build a universal frontend that switches between APIs  
- Add DevOps pipelines (GitHub Actions)
