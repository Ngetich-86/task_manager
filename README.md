# Task Manager PolyStack Lab — My End-to-End Engineering Playground

Welcome to **Task Manager PolyStack Lab**, a multi-tech, multi-discipline learning ground where I explore everything from **Quality Assurance**, **Backend Engineering**, **Frontend Frameworks**, **APIs**, **CLIs**, and even **DevOps concepts**.

This repository started as a simple “Task Manager” project — but quickly evolved into a **full learning ecosystem** where I experiment with different languages, frameworks, architectures, and testing philosophies.  
It’s messy, honest, practical, and full of real experiments — exactly how learning should be.

## QA at a glance

[![node-express-backend tests](https://github.com/Ngetich-86/task_manager/actions/workflows/node-express-backend-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Ngetich-86/task_manager/actions/workflows/node-express-backend-tests.yml)

The most complete testing work in this lab is [`node-express-backend/`](node-express-backend):

- **78 Jest tests** (41 unit, 37 API-layer with Supertest), 74.6% statement coverage, run in GitHub Actions on every change.
- **Grafana k6** smoke, spike and stress profiles with explicit thresholds.
- Written test plans and case sheets: [`test_execution_plan.md`](node-express-backend/test_execution_plan.md), [`unit_integration_test_plan.md`](node-express-backend/unit_integration_test_plan.md).

Details, exact k6 load shapes and known limitations: [node-express-backend/README.md](node-express-backend/README.md#-testing-suite).

## Purpose of This Repo

This repository exists as my:  

- **Hands-on sandbox** for learning new technologies  
- **Reference hub** where I revisit concepts  
- **Place to compare frameworks** (Angular vs Vue vs React, Spring vs Node vs NestJS, etc.)  
- **QA-to-Dev journey tracker** as I grow from testing into full engineering  
- **DevOps starter ground**, integrating scripts, automation, structure, and tooling  

It documents my **engineering evolution** over time.

## 🧩 What’s Inside (Tech Breakdown)

Each folder represents a different experiment around building a simple *Task Manager* application — but implemented using different technology stacks.

---

### 🔹 Frontend Experiments

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `angular-frontend` | Exploring Angular fundamentals, modules, services, routing & RxJS. |
| `vue-frontend` | Learning Vue’s reactivity system, components, and store management (Pinia/Vuex). |

---

### 🔹 Backend Experiments

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `node-backend-qa` | A Node.js backend built intentionally through a QA lens: risk analysis, test techniques, bug hunting. |
| `node-express-backend` | Classic Express REST API to understand routes, controllers, middleware, and validation. |
| `nest-marketplace-api` | A NestJS experiment for enterprise architecture, modules, providers, and structured APIs. |
| `spring-backend` | Java Spring Boot backend exploring controllers, services, JPA, REST patterns. |

---

### 🔹 Other Experiments

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `python-cli` | A Python CLI tool to practice scripting, automation, and terminal interaction. |
| `qa-chronicles` | My QA learning journal: test cases, SDLC concepts, exploratory/smoke/regression testing, etc. |

## 🌱 Why This Repo Exists

Because learning isn’t linear.  
Because real growth happens through **experimentation across multiple stacks**.  
Because great engineers understand multiple worlds and how they connect.

This repo documents my progression from:

**QA → Developer → Multi-stack Engineer → DevOps-aware Builder**

It’s not meant to be perfect — it’s meant to show **curiosity, progress, and exploration**.

---

## 🔮 What’s Next?

Planned improvements:

- Add Docker setups for each backend  
- Add automated tests for Spring & NestJS  
- Create standardized API docs across stacks  
- Build a universal frontend that switches between APIs  
- Add DevOps pipelines (GitHub Actions)
